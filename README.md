# [HuMaps, Discover people through maps]

HuMaps lets you discover people in a little different way; using maps.

Search for developers:

Click on one from the map or the sidebar

## How it works

You search for someone (or more) using their name or occupation. Then you instantly get results on a list and on maps using those peoples' coordinates.

Made with NextJS for both Frontend and the Backend (next-api).

### How the data is stored:

I used Redis as the main database, thanks to RedisJSON.
I have a single Schema which has all the needed fields for each user.

### How the data is accessed:

I used RedisSearch to perform smart assisted lookups. I try to match the search input with users bios (descriptions). Then get a list of those users and render it.
